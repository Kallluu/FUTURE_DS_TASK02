# 📊 Facebook Ads Performance Dashboard

This project is part of my Data Science & Analytics learning journey.  
I am exploring how social media advertising works and how businesses track the success of their campaigns using data.

I used a sample Facebook Ads dataset to practice:
✅ Data cleaning  
✅ Power Query transformations  
✅ Calculating performance metrics  
✅ Building visual dashboards in Power BI  



## ✅ 📌 What I Am Learning
- How impressions, clicks, and ad spend affect digital marketing
- How to calculate important metrics like CTR, CPC, CPM, and conversions
- How dashboards help make decisions in real businesses
- Data cleaning skills using Power Query
- Visualization skills using Power BI

## ✅ 📊 Metrics I Calculated (for practice)
| Metric | Formula | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| CTR | Clicks / Impressions × 100 | Measures how interesting the ad was |
| CPC | Amount Spent / Clicks | How much each click cost |
| CPM | (Amount Spent / Impressions) × 1000 | Cost per 1000 views |
| Conversion Rate | Conversions / Clicks × 100 | Success rate after click |
| Cost Per Conversion | Amount Spent / Conversions | Cost to get one conversion |
| Cost Per Approved Conversion | Amount / Approved_conversion

## ✅ 📈 What I Observed While Learning
- Some ads had high impressions but low clicks
- CTR changes a lot based on age and gender groups
- Cost per click becomes high when clicks are low
- Visual dashboards make patterns easy to understand


## ✅ ✅ Learning Status
- I am still practicing Power BI
- I will keep improving this dashboard
- I may add more visuals and insights as I learn more

This project is just a part of my learning journey in data analytics 😊
